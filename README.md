RedTree Time and Attendance with Payroll Management™ Software
=============================================================

Welcome to the RedTree Time and Attendance with Payroll Management™ Software

This is a personal project that i started a year ago (2011) when i was trying
the Agile Toolkit v4.1.2 - this version now uses a modified version of 4.1.4.

The purpose of this software is to showcase the different necessary features
of Agile Toolkit 4.1.x in developing a large complex application. When i was
just starting, i was struggling understanding the documentation, and where
to really begin and how to put all the examples and techniques i've learned
together to build a useable application.

CURRENT STATUS: I have abandoned development on this software due to the minimum
requirement of the latest Agile Toolkit version (currently 4.2.2) which is
PHP version 5.3 because of the introduction of namespaces in the framework to
avoid name conflicts. It is a show stopper on my end because i cannot easily
upgrade to the required minimum as of the moment but maybe until such time that
version 4.2.x can be smoothly merged into 4.1.x but without the restriction on
PHP versions or an option is built into 4.2.x to support PHP 5.2.x.

This software is solely for educational purposes only and provided as-is with
no warranties whatsoever, implied or otherwise. All bugs reserved.

Please read the INSTALL document on how to install and run this software.
